# PyComex configuration file for conjugated system detection experiment
# This extends the base GNN experiment and adds custom conjugation detection logic

# Extend the base GNN experiment
extend: predict_molecules__gnn.py

# Include the mixin that provides the conjugation detection hooks
include: mixin_conjugated.py

# Dataset parameters
parameters:
  # The name of the dataset to download from ChemMatData file share
  DATASET_NAME: 'aqsoldb'

  # The identification name for this specific experiment variant
  # (using aqsoldb data but detecting conjugated systems as targets)
  DATASET_NAME_ID: 'conjugated'

  # Dataset type determines evaluation metrics
  DATASET_TYPE: 'classification'

  # Number of test samples for evaluation (10% of the dataset)
  NUM_TEST: 0.1

  # Limit to only GIN model for this experiment
  MODELS: ['gin']
