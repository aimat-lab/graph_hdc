  Fingerprint-based Bayesian Optimization for molecular search on QM9 HOMO-LUMO gap.

  This experiment uses the QM9 dataset which contains quantum mechanical properties
  for ~134k small organic molecules. The target property is the HOMO-LUMO gap (index 7),
  which represents the energy difference between the highest occupied and lowest
  unoccupied molecular orbitals - a key property for electronic applications.

  Key features:
  - Morgan (ECFP4) fingerprints for molecular representation
  - Bayesian Optimization with Gaussian Process models from BotTorch
  - Multiple independent trials for robust performance evaluation
  - Efficient search through discrete molecular space
  - Fast computation (no GPU required)

  The HOMO-LUMO gap values range from ~0.02 to ~0.62 eV (mean ~0.25 eV).
  Molecules with specific gap values are important for:
  - Organic semiconductors (small gaps)
  - Photovoltaics (medium gaps)
  - Wide-bandgap materials (large gaps)

  Note: QM9 is a large dataset (133k molecules). We subsample to make BO tractable.

  Bayesian Optimization approach:
  1. Start with random initial samples to build GP surrogate
  2. Iteratively: Train GP -> Compute acquisition -> Select molecules -> Observe values
  3. Track best molecules found over rounds
  4. Average performance across multiple trials

  This provides a baseline for comparison with HDC-based representations.
