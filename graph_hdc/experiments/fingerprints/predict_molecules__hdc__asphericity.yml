description: |
  HDC-based molecular property prediction for Asphericity-Weighted Graph Complexity.

  This experiment uses the AqSolDB dataset structure but replaces the labels with
  a composite regression target that combines 3D molecular shape (asphericity) with
  2D graph complexity (Bertz index). The mixin calculates the product of these two
  global molecular descriptors to test the model's ability to capture both geometric
  and topological features that require large message passing radii.
