description: |
  HDC-based Bayesian Optimization for molecular search on CLogP prediction.

  This experiment uses the AqSolDB dataset structure but optimizes for CLogP
  (calculated LogP) values computed via RDKit's Crippen method instead of the
  default logS (aqueous solubility) values.

  Key features:
  - Hyperdimensional computing (HDC) representations via HyperNet encoder
  - Bayesian Optimization with Gaussian Process models from BotTorch
  - Multiple independent trials for robust performance evaluation
  - Efficient search through discrete molecular space
  - Acquisition function-guided exploration-exploitation trade-off

  The mixin_clogp.py calculates CLogP values for all molecules and replaces the
  graph_labels, which are then used as the target property for optimization.

  Bayesian Optimization approach:
  1. Start with random initial samples to build GP surrogate
  2. Iteratively: Train GP → Compute acquisition → Select molecules → Observe values
  3. Track best molecules found over rounds
  4. Average performance across multiple trials
