description: |
  Fingerprint-based molecular property prediction for conjugated system detection.

  This experiment uses the AqSolDB dataset structure but replaces the labels with
  a binary classification of whether the molecule is fully conjugated. The mixin
  analyzes the molecular structure to determine conjugation status.

  DATASET_NAME: "aqsoldb"
  DATASET_NAME_ID: "conjugated"
  DATASET_TYPE: "binary"
