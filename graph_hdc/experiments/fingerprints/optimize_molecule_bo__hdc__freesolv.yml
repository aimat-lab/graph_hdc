description: |
  HDC-based Bayesian Optimization for molecular search on FreeSolv dataset.

  This experiment uses the FreeSolv dataset which contains experimental hydration
  free energies for small molecules. The dataset contains 639 molecules with measured
  solvation free energies in water (kcal/mol).

  Key features:
  - Hyperdimensional computing (HDC) representations via HyperNet encoder
  - Bayesian Optimization with Gaussian Process models from BotTorch
  - Multiple independent trials for robust performance evaluation
  - Efficient search through discrete molecular space
  - Acquisition function-guided exploration-exploitation trade-off

  The target property is the experimental hydration free energy (index 0), which
  represents the free energy change when a molecule is transferred from gas phase
  to aqueous solution. Values are typically negative (favorable solvation) ranging
  roughly from -25 to +4 kcal/mol.

  Bayesian Optimization approach:
  1. Start with random initial samples to build GP surrogate
  2. Iteratively: Train GP -> Compute acquisition -> Select molecules -> Observe values
  3. Track best molecules found over rounds
  4. Average performance across multiple trials

parameters:
  SEED: 1

  NOTE: |
    Bayesian Optimization experiment for FreeSolv (hydration free energy) molecular search
    using HDC representations. Expected Improvement acquisition function with 15 initial
    samples and 20 BO rounds. Target value of -10.0 kcal/mol represents a moderately
    hydrophilic molecule. Dataset has 639 molecules with experimental solvation data.
