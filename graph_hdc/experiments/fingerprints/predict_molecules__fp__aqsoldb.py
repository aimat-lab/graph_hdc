# == DATASET PARAMETERS ==

# :param DATASET_NAME:
#       The name of the dataset to be used for the experiment. This name is used to download the dataset from the
#       ChemMatData file share.
DATASET_NAME: str = 'aqsoldb'
# :param DATASET_NAME_ID:
#       The name of the dataset to be used later on for the identification of the dataset. This name will NOT be used 
#       for the downloading of the dataset but only later on for identification. In most cases these will be the same 
#       but in cases for example one dataset is used as the basis of some deterministic calculation of the target values 
#       and in this case the name should identify it as such.
DATASET_NAME_ID: str = DATASET_NAME
# :param DATASET_TYPE:
#       The type of the dataset, either 'classification' or 'regression'. This parameter is used to determine the
#       evaluation metrics and the type of the prediction target.
DATASET_TYPE: str = 'regression'
# :param NUM_TEST:
#       The number of test samples to be used for the evaluation of the models.

# == FINGERPRINT PARAMETERS ==

# :param FINGERPRINT_SIZE:
#       The size of the fingerprint to be generated. This will be the number of elements in the 
#       fingerprint vector representation of each molecule.
FINGERPRINT_SIZE: int = 2048 * 4
# :param FINGERPRINT_RADIUS:
#       The radius of the fingerprint to be generated. This parameter determines the number of
#       bonds to be considered when generating the fingerprint.
