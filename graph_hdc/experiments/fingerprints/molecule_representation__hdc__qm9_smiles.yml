# PyComex configuration file for QM9 SMILES dataset HDC molecule representation
pycomex: true

extend: molecule_representation__hdc.py

name: molecule_representation_hdc_qm9_smiles_polarizability

description: |
  HDC-based molecular representation investigation on the QM9 SMILES dataset.

  This configuration analyzes how HDC hypervectors cluster molecules with
  respect to their polarizability values (TARGET_INDEX=4).

  The experiment generates:
  - 2D PCA and UMAP visualizations colored by clogp and polarizability
  - PCA variance analysis across multiple dimensions
  - Statistics on how much variance is explained by different dimensionalities
