description: |
  GNN-based molecular property prediction for TPSA-BalabanJ synthetic property.

  This experiment uses the AqSolDB dataset structure but replaces the labels with
  a composite regression target that combines the Balaban J index (a global topological
  descriptor based on distance matrices) with TPSA (Topological Polar Surface Area).
  The mixin calculates BalabanJ × (1 + TPSA/100) to create a synthetic property that
  tests the model's ability to capture global molecular features requiring large
  message passing radii.

  DATASET_NAME: "aqsoldb"
  DATASET_NAME_ID: "tpsa_balananj"
  DATASET_TYPE: "regression"
