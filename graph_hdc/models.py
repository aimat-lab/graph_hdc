        of this projection should be proportional to the number of times that node type was present in the original
        graph.
        
        Therefore, we iterate over all the possible node property combinations and calculate the projection of the
        graph embedding along the direction of the node hypervector. If the magnitude of this projection is non-zero
        we can assume that this node type was present in the original graph and we derive the number of times it was
